TODO list, CARS:

- Sex default unselected
- Add descriptor of covariates - as smaller text always visibile

- change colors to be on/off, not red/green
- Bigger font for covariates
- try and keep all choices on mobile screen
- Christina to make Danish version
- Questionnaire for test users
- Reduce font size of subtitle - move para down
- Make CARS bold
- Add result in colored box

- If have time - add graph showing relation to CHADVASC

Decisions made
- do not add CI or patient numbers - because this would not be useful in helping clinicians/patients make decisions
- Christina send R code for forest plot of CHADVASC
