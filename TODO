TODO list, CARS:

- Add descriptor of covariates - as smaller text always visibile
- Questionnaire for test users
- If have time - add graph showing relation to CHADVASC





Decisions made
- do not add CI or patient numbers - because this would not be useful in helping clinicians/patients make decisions
- Christina send R code for forest plot of CHADVASC
