# riskvisrr
Shiny app to visualize the 1-year risk of stroke.

This is developed as an R package for initial development, but will later be structured differently to allow hosting on a webserver. This current version is intended for use by physicians.

To launch:
```
devtools::load_all(".")
riskCalc()
```
